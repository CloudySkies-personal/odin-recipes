# odin-recipes

This is the first project from The Odin Project that I will be tackling. It is a culmination of all I have learned about the foundations of HTML, as well as a hands-on review for the use of Github. 

TODO:
 - Incorporate the use of flexbox onto pork-sisig.html and toad-in-the-hole.html, as is already done in leche-flan.html
 - Add a navigation bar on every page to allow for more interactivity
